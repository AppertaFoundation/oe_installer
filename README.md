OpenEyes
========

Introduction
------------

OpenEyes is a collaborative, open source, project led by Moorfields Eye Hospital. The goal is to produce a framework which will allow the rapid, and continuous development of electronic patient records (EPR) with contributions from Hospitals, Institutions, Academic departments, Companies, and Individuals.

The initial focus is on Ophthalmology, but the design is sufficiently flexible to be used for any clinical specialty.

Ophthalmic units of any size, from a single practitioner to a large eye hospital, should be able to make use of the structure, design, and code to produce a functional, easy to use EPR at minimal cost. By sharing experience, pooling ideas, and distributing development effort, it is expected that the range and capability of OpenEyes will evolve rapidly.

News
----

After a successful launch of the OpenEyes core and the Booking module in January 2012, as of May 2012 we are completing work on three ophthalmic modules for initial deployment at Moorfields: Prescription, Operation Note, and Correspondence.  These will be followed rapidly by an Examination module after which the core team should have more time to help facilitate third party development.  We will shortly be launching a more up to date and revised version of our website.
