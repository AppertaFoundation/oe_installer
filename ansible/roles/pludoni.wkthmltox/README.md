Role Name
=========

Installs wkhtmltopdf as .deb for Ubuntu.


Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: pludoni.wkthmltox
           wkhtmltox_install_fonts: true
           wkhtmltox_main_version: 0.12.2-dev
           wkhtmltox_minor_version: 0.12.2-dev-5dea253
