Moorfields PAS module for connection to existing patient record system.

See docs/INSTALL.txt for installation instructions

Notes:
- Core should be migrated up to or beyond m120327_154616_remove_pas_patient_assignment before enabling
- When doing migrations or bulk data changes that do not require PAS interaction, it is advisable to temporarily disable pas by setting the 'mehpas_enabled' param.
