<p><strong>Re: Some text</strong></p>

<p>Dear <?php echo $to; ?>,</p>

<p>
	This patient was recently referred to this hospital and a decision was
	made that surgery was appropriate under the care of
	<?php echo CHtml::encode($consultantName) ?>.
</p>

<p>In accordance with the National requirements our admission system
	provides patients with the opportunity to agree the date for their
	operation. We have written twice to ask the patient to contact us to
	discuss and agree a date but we have had no response.</p>

<p>Therefore we have removed this patient from our waiting list and we
	are referring them back to you.</p>

<p nobr="true">
	Yours sincerely,
	<br/><br/><br/><br/>
	Admissions Officer
</p>
