	In order to navigate OpenEyes
	As an OpenEyes user
	I need a header containing links

		Given I am on "/"
		When I log in as "admin:admin:Enoch:Root"
		Then I should see an "#selected_firm_id" element

		Given I am logged in as "admin:admin:Enoch:Root"
		And I am on "<current_url>"
		When I follow "<item>"
		Then the "#user_nav li span.selected" element should contain "<item>"
		And I should be on "<target_url>"
		And the "#content > h2" element should contain "<page_title>"
