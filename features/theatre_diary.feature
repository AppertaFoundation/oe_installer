Feature: Theatre Diary
	In order to manage operation bookings
	As a OpenEyes user
	I need to be able to get to the theatre diary

	Background:
		Given I am logged in as "admin:admin:Enoch:Root"

	# Need to work out a way to test the sample data with this
	# @regression @regression:1 @sample-data @javascript
	# Scenario: 1.19 Select patient from diary and change firm  

	@regression @regression:1 @sample-data @javascript
	Scenario Outline: 1.14|1.18 Theatre Diary defaults change depending on selected firm
		Given I am on "/"
		When I select "<firmselect>" firm
		And I wait "0.5" seconds # Fix for selenium webdriver moving too fast
		And I follow "Theatre Diaries"
		And I wait "0.5" seconds # Fix for selenium webdriver moving too fast
		Then I should see "<service>" in the "#subspecialty-id" dropdown
		And I should see "<firm>" in the "#firm-id" dropdown
